** Breaking changes

- Dropped support for Emacs 24.4.
  At least Emacs 25.1 is required now.

- Removed many obsolete variable and function aliases.

- Removed many obsolete variables that are not mere aliases.

- Removed ~magit-section~ accessor functions.
  Use ~oref~ and ~oset~ instead.

** Changes since v2.13.0

- ~magit-describe-section~ now pops up a ~*Help*~ buffer showing which
  hook and function produced the section.  The old
  ~magit-describe-section~ is renamed to
  ~magit-describe-section-briefly~.
